                <p>
                Python, HTML, CSS, Responsive Websites, flexbox, lists, anchor tags, clickable link, organic design, 
                <br>
                open source, to name a few, are new language expressions emerging from the experience! It has become
                <br>
                 an indelible creative imprint with the power of braking the 'old' code in 'me' and make a new one!
                <br>
                <br>
                Whether with art, photography, history and writing, the journey begins with an exploration of how  
                <br> 
                one responds to the learning process of coding!  in the context of "learning as you Go".
                <br>
                <br>
                This has been a tough experience ... as I am not generation X,  I am pleased to have been able to make 
                <br>
                a website of my own!   the process has been that of getting to know better where my limitations are in 
                <br>
                terms of technology!   learning to 'code' and whilst doing the 'coding' has been an eye opener for  a 
                <br>
                world of possibilities!  it has equipped me with new perspectives and has expanded my knowledge base to 
                <br>
                work more effectively.

            <p>

                I find inspiration in the work mentees do.  Currently I provide support to a group of women of hispanic 
                <br>
                descend who are setting up a website to have presence on the web!    The experience is equally valuable 
                <br>
                for mentoring studens in their last year of their degree whilst in the process of thinking about what to write 
                <br>
                their dissertations about.  Coding offers a platform to think and do things differently!

            <div><h2>Transferable Skills</h2></div>

            <p>
                From a psychological and psychotherapeutic perspectives,  having been introduced to the field of Coding seems 
                <br>
                so natural to me ... skills like analytical thinking, critical thinking, creaivity, Information management,
                <br>
                judgements and decision making, adaptability, integrity, self-regulation, collaboration, inclusivity, leadership, 
                <br>
                management, service orientation, flexibility/adaptability to new systems, to name a few!
                <br>
                <br>
                Learning to code with Python is a skill everybody should have!  it is a very useful tool based on the 'give and take' 
                <br>
                communication system, offering plenty of possibilities, for example: the development of neurological nurturing 
                <br>
                and neurological nourishment programs targetting children's character development!

                Do you enjoy walking in the rain?  I do.  Do you like to be 'fit'?  I do.  Do you seek defining moments
                <br>
                to be in awe?  I do.  Pursuing the Extraordinary for the sake of human kind  is something to be found in the world
