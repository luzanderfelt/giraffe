        <h3>Scketching the portrait of my worldview</h3>
        <p>
        Hi, I am Luz Anderfelt. I am a psychologist/psychotherapist currently focusing on how to apply neuroscience to our daily lives!  This is my 
        <br>
        "About Me" website and a 'blog' will follow on 'applied research' and opinions about the broader field(s) I am in to marry computational 
        <br>
        iniciatives. To learn more about me, my interests and my work visit my website under the name 'Home of Senses' (still under construction) 
        <br>
        _I am building it my self from scratch! 'Home of senses' implies our 'human condition' and is intended to convey awareness as to how 'we' 
        <br>
        work! A seemingly specific meaning yet on closer inspection, as I dont want it to be vague or even misleading, our bodies are 'vessels' 
        <br>
        navigating in time and space! I do hope these three words gain value through the process of getting to know ourselves better! 
        <br>
        "Who am I"? How can we find ways to figure it out! is the purpose of my 'applied research' blog. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>A glance of 'who am I'</h3>   
        <p>
        'I am an eagle when learning! On a helicopter ride when working 'organisationally!' Sailing when designing a website! In all, Luz has a
        <br>
        genuine interest in people across cultures.  I like to think that I am an optimist and have a firm belief that people's capacity to do
        <br>
        great things depends on what they believe about themselves, and how they choose to portray it!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Never say no to Python! 'What's past is prologue!' <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"target="-blank">Code Nation,</a>  is a coding school!  I came to realise that 'coding' and 
        <br>
        neuroscience have a lot in common and that a marriage between the two have the potential to be 'true parents' to create neurological
        <br> 
        nurture and nourishment for children's character development through play!  'coding' can potentially be a matter of being in the present!
