        <div><h2>2.1  Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h2></div>
        <p>
            At this momment I began to realise the difference between a computer language programming and network hosts, team up, learn, create, share,
            <br>
            responsive designs!  The Visual Code is the first tool that introduced me to walk my first steps in the learning to communicate with python!  
            <br>
            and html and css! As an indelible imprint of 'coding' in my mind, coding is in essence a conversational language.  But it is not and IT tool!  
            <br>
            <br>
            From my 'debutant' learning stage, Trello boards have a lot of potential!  to test the new learning!  However, they can only be useful for 
            <br>
            people who are truly team players, and who have a share on the project.  It may also be helpful for stakeholders too!  Trello Boards begings 
            <br>
            with 'flash backs' and relies on the use of my memory!    
            <br>
        </p>

        <div><h2>2.2  Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2></div>
        <p>
            Trello boards as an assessment tool for learning teams who work remotely must be magnificent!  I just made some search of its usefulness
            <br>
            and found that Trello boards for mentoring and teaching can be highly useful to keep track of tasks and follow their progress for teams working
            <br>
            remotely!  I am actually using it now to put together the different tasks to mentor myself as to how to build presence on the web!
            <br>
            <br>
            The visual Studio Code is being useful!  I tried Codepen but it didnt deliver what it promised to deliver unless you purchase an upgrade!  
            <br>
            
           
        </p>
        <div><h2>2.3  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with your website?  Why? 
            <br>
            Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2></div>
        <p>
            I have already made a few changes!  whilst following some instructions from some generous webdesigners on you tube and codeacademy 
            <br>
            and w3docs.com who kindly describe the process! and provides plenty of cues ... and pieces of code for us to cut and paste for the making 
            <br>
            of our final puzzle! Big mistake!  My entire coding I have produced disappeared!  So I lost all the work!  I realise now, that the CSS 
            <br>
            teaches the human mind to be discerning, a skill one learns with time!  -if one doesn't have a mind and a body working together, we 
            <br>
            are basically dead!   
            <br>
            <br>
            What would I change?  I would convert the various pages involved in this assignment in what I would call my learning experience portfolio! 
            <br>
            Portraying enthusiasm for a change of direction, for example!  I would add music!  tutorial videos!  some art!  
            <br>
            <br>
            So at some point, I was ambivalent as to what direction to give to my new knowledge.  But lo and behold!   As I became more comfortable  
            <br> 
            relating to google; relating to what I found on various websites after posting a search question; and relating to my personal self, 
            <br>
            my fears, my stengths and my challenges ... now that I type directly on to the Visual Code, my self confidence gradually came back!  
            <br>
            My creative side in her talking out loud  began to giggle as I managed to put all the pieces together!  The page began to show 
            <br>
            form and shape!  and make sense ... I talk to my self more ... I talk aloud!  and as I live alone!  I now feel my own company! 
            <br>
            The process is now working under my skin! 
            <br>
         
        </p>
        <div><h2>2.4  Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2></div>
        <p>
            A striken background image may be a possibility ... although that may be for the future when mastering the usage of all the resources 
            <br>
            available!
        </p>
        <div><h2>2.5  Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2></div>
        <p>
            The whole process has been rather illuminating!  in one way or another, a transition from feeling redundant to a more productive persona!
            <br>
            This has been a process of gaining awareness of being nowhere to being somewhere!  It has made me go back to the about me page many times, 
            <br>
            and I could still make some improvements!   But I need to stop somehow!  I need to feel that it is good enough as it is!
            <br>
            Althoug I didnt meet the deadline!  I dont expect to pass the course, however I still want to make it to Github.  I feel more agility on my 
            <br>
            fingers as they have a go at playing over the keyboard with more confidence whilst typing some coding without having to 'cut and paste'
            <br>
             ...  From a rough sailing to a more smooth way of navigating towards 'blue waters'!
