            <p>
                The About Me page using VS Code.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is the Home Page.  The structure of the webpage uses a navigation bar, headers, divisions, hyperlinks, paragraphs, images and logos.
                <br>
                It is made with two main elements! namely, the Navigation Bar and the body!  The Navigation Bar is a user interface element within the
                <br>
                'about me' webpage and includes the links to other pages of the website.  In this instance, the navigation bar is displayed as a horizontal
                <br>
                list of links at the top of each page. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The body or content of the page is what is visible to the user.  is divided in two sections, namely, the header: is made of my name and a 
               <br>
                glance of my worldview.  The second division of the page is made of a brief description of 'who am I' in my engagement with work and a map
                <br>
                of my destination.  
                <br>
                <br>
                The layout of the page is made of the first step which is to call upon the html:5 as the 'doctype', being the first thing that needs define.
                <br>
                The tag prompts automatically at the starting point of the work. It comprises the formating direction of 'language', followed by the 'meta' tag,
                <br>
                meaning, it defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.  The 'meta' tags always go inside the 
                <br>
                'head' element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
                <br>
                Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.  Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), 
                <br>
                search engines (keywords), and other web services.  For more information <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="-blank">click here</a> and search for a a complete meta tag list.
                <br>
                The website offers tutorials, quizes and exersices, as well as specific term search fully outlined on the left side of the body of the webpage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Along with the 'meta' tag goes the 'charset' of the 'Unicode Transformation Format' 8, meaning "a character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes 
                <br>
                long.  UTF-8 represents any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding 
                <br>
                for e-mail and web pages" as defined by w3schools.  The above represents everything one needs in a webpage!
                <br>
                Finally, the body' is made of all the content that is visible to the user!

                <br>
                The Home page is the landing page.  The landing page is html encoded by the meta tag 'viewport'  It is the users visible area of the webpage.  
                <br>
                It is the 'face', therefore the image of the webpage.  And the following 'content' of the tag provides  sets the width of the page adjusted 
                <br>
                to the width of the screen device.

                The Navigation Bar containes the links to the pages as required by the assignment.  I planned to include an image with the author's logo
                <br>
                as a student!  The header shows a brief message which includes my name and two lines describing a glance of the author's worldview.  It sits 
                <br>
                on a colourful self portrait I took when travelling in the Americas!  The use of colour used in a harmonious way can be pleasant to the human

                matter' is intended to receive any opinions or feedback on the page per se.  Both of the buttons are coded as a hyperlink directly to my email 
                <br>
                address for a swifter engagement.  The 'container' is coded with the paragraph tag and describes briefly 'who am I' in my engagement with 
                <br>
                work and a map of my journey together with a potential destination.
