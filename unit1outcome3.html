                productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How?

            <p>
                A website 'About Me' requires a lot of reflexion and plenty of engagement with 'learning as you go'.  It is a creative process by which One is 
                <br>
                learning to view ourselves as an entire organisation!  - Whether one is gearing the end result as an 'internal' or an 'external' consultant!  
                <br>
                We are actually already part of a team whilst we are in this process!  We are connected by Slack! We are all either requesting some support or 
                <br>
                providing support!  We are not alone!  Even if we are working remotely!  So yes!  to manage IT tools, team work is essentially the best way
                <br>
                to be productive!  And Yes!  there are parts of the whole process that would benefit from more than a couple of eyes and more tan one brain!
                <br>
                More than one soul and more than one spirit!  The 'give and take' within a group is primordial for mental sanity! as it is the sense of humour!
                <br>
                I just managed to complete the whole assignment.  Am I happy with it? No completely!  but I believe its a good enough piece of work for my
                <br>
                my purpose!  I feel like I just managed to cross the line after all my colleagues already crossed it a long time ago!  but I did it!  Thanks
                <br>
                Code Nation; thank Ezra; thanks Jay; thanks Lilly; thanks to all of you! and finally, thanks to this marvelloous cohort I was part of!

                <br>
                but in the physical world too!  Three days working together whilst in the process of enhancing 'getting to know ourselves!  which may be useful 
                <br>
                for productivity and consultancy purposes. The aim of this excersice would be to build a personal image that develops from the team's perception. 
                <br>
                It would be about group work to learn to develop eachother's narrative!  to thus facilitate the emergence of people's dormant persona! something
                <br>
