            to a greater world.  However, this development does not come free or without dangers!'

        <div><h2>1.2  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
            – what do you need to make projects successful?  What tools? What skills?</h2></div>
        <p>
            First things first.   And the life of a project begins at home; therefore, communication as a basic human need is the first engagement ally 
            <br>
            … I need a great deal of communication skills.  If I have a genuine motivation to enquiry within the digital world, then, to make projects 
            <br>
            successful I would have to start with getting hardware and software.   A computer, whether a laptop or a Desktop, depending on the nature 
            <br>
            of the project, is the vehicle for creating your interface with the world!   A telephone line!  Whether a mobile or a cable line are very 
            <br>
            important!  And last but not the least, without Internet, the project won’t be able to reach its purpose!  
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, learning to equip yourself with those skills i.e. computer skills and knowledge as to how to do research on the net is just imperative 
            <br>
            and part of the primary task!  Research! Research! Research!  Married to the haves and the workings of an optimised awareness of what 
            <br>
            ‘critical thinking’ means will come handy!  
            <br>
            <br>
            Digital projects require a great deal of thinking rationally and a good dose of ability for the understanding of logical connections between 
            <br>
            ideas.   Also, a good dose of discerning ability is primordial if the project is geared to make a difference!  Be willing to seek until found.   
            <br>
            Networking! Collaborate, contribute, socialise.  Become really open and engaging! 
            <br>
            <br>
            To learn more about Critical thinking skills, go to the actual webise and browse for the various skills you may find useful to develop, 
            <br>
            not without engaging purposefully with a little reflection as to   <a href="https://www.skillsyouneed.com/" target="-blank">"How could I possibly have done it better next time!"</a>

        <div><h2>1.3  Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
            <br>
            Include a link to your Trello board.</h2></div>
        <p>
            Tasks like:  defining the purpose; defining the scope; outline resources; outline the risks; think and note down the networking 
            <br>
            possibilities; define the logistics; develop organically.   Soon after the idea of my website is tested and spread out amongst family, friends 
            <br>
            and network constellations, the loop will return feedback.  Trello boards  can become this engaging …  it helps me to keep track of the project 
            <br>
            to manage feasibility, reflexion and engagement.    It records the life of the project since its conception.  It’s not useful when used for 
            <br>
            purposes other than project management. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I watched the Trello board free Webinar describing in detail its uses and the ‘know hows’.

        <div><h2>1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2></div>
        <p>
            Risk is reality and reality cannot be predicted.  Despite our best efforts, it’s not always possible to have straight answers to the question.  
            <br>
            Change is a given, so everything around the project can change in front of our eyes!  We are currently living the era of a 180 degrees change 
            <br>
            married to the survival-of-the-fastest/fittest ethos which is insistently knocking our doors … only a few hear the knock!  Those few are working 
            <br>
            incessantly to adjust and accommodate to ‘change’.  We need now to learn to be that change which calls for more elasticity, flexibility and 
            <br>
            engagement in our thinking and our doing!   The digital world is waiting to be used as our primary tool!
            <br>
            In the interim, save the work before loosing it to Internet failure, power failure and computer crash! Be constantly aware of your resources!  
            <br>
            Learn to have plenty of sense of humour … have a look at what the British Culture can offer in terms of sense of humour, make a difference and 
            <br>
            learning opportunities!

            GitHub works as a laboratory in the cloud where developers store, create, test, collaborate, and validate ‘coding’ for digital projects.  
            <br>
            A place where your project can be connected to the world ... a place to build presence on the web!
            <br>
            <br>
            In the scheme of things, GitHub works like a brain and a mind (I am still looking for the heart, which should undoubtedly be somewhere!)  
            <br>
            I just need to use it and see what comes out of it.!

        <div><h2>1.7  Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – 
            <br>
            How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2></div>
        <p>
            Human Rights regulations and political correctness has been the main impact on digital projects. In a few words, any project needs to
            <br>
            implement a process to show evidence of not violating the individual's right to privacy and confidentiality when manipulating personal data.
            <br>
            <br>
            In simple words, the GDPR regulations are drawn on the basis of respect for fundamental human rights.  The Human Rights Convention provides 
            <br>
            that governments have a duty to ensure that national laws provide adequate protection for personal data.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Intellectual Property also may impact digital projects.  In addition to this, Ethics should also be at the heart of professional practice, 
            <br>
            as well as Social Responsibility.  It is common nowadays to talk about Digital Ethics as technology has the potential to shape people’s future. 
            <br>
            With digital ethics comes the added variable of assessing the ethical implications of things, which may not yet exist, or things, which may have 
            <br>
            impacts, we cannot predict.   What do we do? Have plenty of sense of humour and live with a conciencius Responsibility!

            <br>
            However, any Digital Project resident in the UK with a global scope would still need to comply with the European Data Protection laws.
